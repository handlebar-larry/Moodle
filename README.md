   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Run on your device**
   - **Physical Device (Recommended)**: 
     - Install "Expo Go" from App Store/Play Store
     - Scan QR code shown in terminal
   - **iOS Simulator (Mac)**: Press `i` in terminal

   - **Web Browser**: Press `w` in terminal (limited audio support)

For detailed setup instructions, see [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md).

##  Architecture

### State Management (Zustand)

The app uses **Zustand** for state management with 5 main stores:

1. **Player Store** (`playerStore.ts`)
   - Manages playback state (current song, position, duration, playing status)
   - Handles queue operations (add, remove, reorder, set)
   - Implements shuffle and repeat modes
   - Persists queue and settings to AsyncStorage

2. **Search Store** (`searchStore.ts`)
   - Manages search results and pagination
   - Stores recent searches
   - Handles search state (loading, error, query, page)

3. **Theme Store** (`themeStore.ts`)
   - Manages light/dark theme mode
   - Provides theme colors based on current mode
   - Persists theme preference to AsyncStorage

4. **Playlist Store** (`playlistStore.ts`)
   - Manages user-created playlists
   - Handles playlist operations (create, delete, add song, remove song)
   - Persists playlists to AsyncStorage

5. **Favorites Store** (`favoritesStore.ts`)
   - Manages favorite songs list
   - Handles add/remove favorite operations
   - Persists favorites to AsyncStorage

### Audio Playback Service

The `audioPlayer` service handles all audio operations:
- **Background Playback**: Configured using `expo-av` with background audio mode
- **Position Tracking**: Updates every 500ms when playing
- **Auto-play Next**: Automatically plays next song when current finishes
- **Quality Selection**: Automatically selects best available audio quality (prefers 320kbps → 160kbps → 96kbps → 48kbps)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of playback errors

### Navigation Structure

```
App Navigator (Stack)
├── MainTabs (Bottom Tabs)
│   ├── Home
│   ├── Favorites
│   ├── Playlists
│   └── Settings
├── Search (Modal)
├── Player (Full Screen)
├── Queue (Modal)
├── SongList
├── ArtistDetail
└── AlbumDetail
```

### API Integration

The app integrates with the JioSaavn API:
- **Base URL**: `https://saavn.sumit.co/`
- **No API Key Required**: Public API endpoints
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `/api/search/songs` - Search songs with pagination
  - `/api/search/artists` - Search artists with pagination
  - `/api/search/albums` - Search albums with pagination
  - `/api/songs/{id}` - Get song details
  - `/api/songs/{id}/suggestions` - Get song suggestions
  - `/api/artists/{id}` - Get artist details
  - `/api/artists/{id}/songs` - Get artist's songs (with pagination)
  - `/api/artists/{id}/albums` - Get artist's albums

##  Key Features Implementation

### Background Playback
- Configured in `app.json` with `UIBackgroundModes: ["audio"]` for iOS
- Android permissions for `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `WAKE_LOCK`
- Audio mode set to `staysActiveInBackground: true` in `audioPlayer.ts`
- Proper audio session configuration for uninterrupted playback

### State Synchronization
- Mini Player and Full Player share the same Zustand store
- Position updates are reactive - both components update automatically
- Store subscriptions ensure UI stays perfectly in sync
- No manual state prop drilling required

### Queue Persistence
- Queue is saved to AsyncStorage whenever it changes
- Loaded automatically on app start
- Survives app restarts and device reboots
- Includes current position and playing status

### Pagination
- **Home Screen**: Infinite scroll loads 100 songs/artists per page
- **Search Screen**: Load more on scroll with pagination
- **Artist Detail**: "Load More" button to fetch all songs (100 per page)
- Progress indicators shown during loading

### Theme System
- Light and dark themes with complete color schemes
- Theme toggle in Settings screen
- Preference persisted to AsyncStorage
- All screens and components are theme-aware

##  Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Zustand over Redux Toolkit
- **Decision**: Used Zustand for simpler API and less boilerplate
- **Trade-off**: Less ecosystem tools, but sufficient for this app size
- **Benefit**: Easier to learn and maintain, faster development

### 2. AsyncStorage over MMKV
- **Decision**: Used AsyncStorage for better Expo compatibility
- **Trade-off**: Slightly slower than MMKV, but works seamlessly with Expo Go
- **Benefit**: No native module compilation needed

### 3. Manual Queue Reordering
- **Decision**: Used up/down buttons instead of drag-and-drop
- **Trade-off**: Less intuitive UX, but more compatible across platforms
- **Benefit**: Works consistently on all devices and screen sizes

### 4. Infinite Scroll Pagination
- **Decision**: Load more on scroll instead of numbered pages
- **Trade-off**: Can't jump to specific pages, but better UX for mobile
- **Benefit**: More natural mobile interaction pattern

### 5. Auto Quality Selection
- **Decision**: Automatically selects best available quality
- **Trade-off**: No user control over quality, but ensures best experience
- **Benefit**: Simpler UX, always plays best available quality

### 6. Real API Integration
- **Decision**: All data comes from real API calls
- **Trade-off**: Requires internet connection, but meets requirements
- **Benefit**: Real-world data, proper error handling

##  Building for Production

### Android APK
```bash
# Install EAS CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build APK
eas build -p android --profile preview

# Or build locally (requires Android Studio)
npm run android
```

### iOS
```bash
# Build iOS app
eas build -p ios --profile preview
```

##  Known Limitations

1. **Offline Downloads**: Download functionality is not fully implemented (bonus feature)
2. **Lyrics Display**: API provides `hasLyrics` flag but not actual lyrics data
3. **Queue Drag & Drop**: Simplified to up/down buttons for better compatibility
4. **Audio Quality Control**: Automatically selects best quality (no manual control)
5. **Album Details**: Album detail endpoint is limited, uses search as fallback

##  Future Enhancements

- Full offline download functionality
- Lyrics display when available
- Equalizer and audio effects
- Sleep timer
- Widget support for home screen
- Social features (share playlists, songs)
- Playlist sharing via links
- Audio waveform visualization
- Cross-device sync
- Podcast support

##  Troubleshooting

### Audio not playing in background
- Ensure `UIBackgroundModes` is configured in `app.json`
- Check Android permissions in `app.json`
- Verify audio mode is set correctly in `audioPlayer.ts`
- Test on physical device (emulators may have limitations)

### Build errors
- Clear cache: `expo start --clear`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node.js version (requires v16+)

### Metro bundler errors
- Stop Metro bundler (Ctrl+C)
- Clear cache: `expo start --clear`
- Restart: `npm start`

### Navigation issues
- Ensure React Navigation dependencies are properly installed
- Check that navigation structure matches type definitions
- Verify all screens are properly registered

### API errors
- Check internet connection
- Verify API base URL is correct
- Check API response format matches expected structure
